List of DNS entries that are relevant to email delivery:

PTR:
    ===========================================================================
    Email relays may do a PTR lookup on the sending IP address to verify if the
    lookup returns the same domain for the IP address as the one in the email
    message. PTR record can be configured with the hosting provider.

    For example, to do a reverse lookup of the IP address 8.8.4.4 the PTR
    record for the domain name 4.4.8.8.in-addr.arpa would be looked up, and
    found to point to google-public-dns-b.google.com. If the A record for
    google-public-dns-b.google.com in turn pointed back to 8.8.4.4 then it
    would be said to be forward-confirmed.
	
	Relevant RFC section: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5451#section-3

    forward-confirmed test for an email address asdf@asdf.com:

        1) A record lookup on asdf.com returns IP address of 1.2.3.4
            dig -t A asdf.com
            mail.asdf.com           10      IN  A   1.2.3.4

        2) PTR lookup for 1.2.3.4 returns hostname of db12.asdf.com
	    dig -x 1.2.3.4
            4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa.   3222    IN  PTR db12.asdf.com

        3) A record lookup confirms the IP address returned from MX lookup
            dig -t A db12.asdf.com
            db12.asdf.com           183     IN  A   1.2.3.4

    Lookup command:
        dig [+noall] [+answer] -x aa.bb.cc.dd


    Example DNS zone configuration:
	
	asdf.com
		A 	@ 	1.2.3.4
		A	mail	1.2.3.4
		MX	@ 	mail.asdf.com	

	Wiki:
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward-confirmed_reverse_DNS

		The requirement is the forward and reverse lookup for the sending relay
		have to match, it does not have to be related to the from-field or 
		sending domain of messages it relays.

		Most e-mail mail transfer agents (server software) use a FCrDNS 
		verification and if there is a valid domain name, put it into 
		the "Received:" trace header field.

TXT:
    ===========================================================================
    SPF (RFC4408[2006] and RFC7208[2014])
        An SPF record is a type of Domain Name Service (DNS) record that
        identifies which mail servers are permitted to send email on
        behalf of your domain.

        Value Format:
            v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all

            v: version
            include: The "include" mechanism triggers a recursive evaluation of
                check_host().
            all: Mechanisms after "all" will never be tested.

        Lookup command:
            SPF lookup is a regular TXT lookup:
                dig -t txt [domain] [+short]

    ===========================================================================
    DKIM (RFC6376 [2007] and RFC4871 [2011]):
        DKIM allows for email signing using public key.
        DKIM entries are stored in TXT records.
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4871

        TXT record is a DNS lookup Key that return a Value. The Value for DKIM
        follows Key-Value pattern too.

        Key Format:
            [custom_string]._domainkey.[domain]

            e.g.
            somestring._domainkey.myexampledomain.com

        Value Format:
            v=DKIM1; g=*; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBA......

            v: Version (plain-text; REQUIRED)
            g: (DEPRECATED)
                Granularity of the key (plain-text; OPTIONAL, default is "*").
                "g=" does not mean "g=*", even though "g=*" is the default for
                that tag.
            k: Key type (plain-text; OPTIONAL, default is "rsa").
            p: Public-key data (base64; REQUIRED).

        Lookup command:
            For DKIM lookup
                dig -t txt [custom_string]._domainkey.[domain] [+short]

    ===========================================================================
    DMARC (7489 [2015])
        Allows you to specify how mail servers should handle messages from
        your domain that do not have valid SPF and DKIM records setup.

        v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:mailauth-reports@google.com
		v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=none; rf=afrf; pct=100; ri=86400

        Lookup command:
            For DMARC lookup
                dig -t txt _dmarc.[domain] [+short]
